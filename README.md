# Betfred Main Footer Template

Static HTML and CSS copy of the footer from the [betfred](https://www.betfred.com/) website, using SASS as a preprocessor and Parcel and as a module bundler.

## Running Locally

Install using package manager of choice; I use NPM. This is a local installation only and not hosted live anywhere.

```
npm init

npm install

npm start

```

- `npm init` - Initialize NPM and generate package.json.

- `npm install` - This installs parcel-bundler and sass as dependancies.

- `npm start` - Runs Parcel, compliles SASS to CSS and runs locally on [localhost1234](http://localhost:1234/).
